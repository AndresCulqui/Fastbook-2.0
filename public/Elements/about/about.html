			<h1> Fastbook </h1>
			Fast-Book.com is a web application designed to facilitate the exchange of textbooks, providing a service increasingly used as the second hand market, in our case, textbooks, academic, literary, poetic ones and so on.

			What we want with our application is to provide a useful and free service to the community, which is characterized by its simplicity, speed and ease of use, so that Fast-Book automates all typical processes which occur in program exchanges, with the objective o everything being done quickly and easily.
			The Idea

			Fast-Book.com is a website in which anyone can give a new life to your used books , the ones you no longer want to keep, selling them to recover some of your initial investment, or simply giving them away as you interchange them with somebody else.

			At the same time, users can search an extensive catalog and buy or exchange the used books they need.
			The Goal

			In Fast-Book.com we aim to extend the maximum possible use of our service in the market of second-hand books, throughout the entire country in order to ensure that everyone has access to textbooks you need or you are looking for. That’s why we can guarantee a good price for both the buyer and the seller.

			In addition to an exchange platform of textbooks, Fast-Book.com allows sending notifications and communicating them via email to users to keep them informed about their future purchases, as well as new books are added to our application.
